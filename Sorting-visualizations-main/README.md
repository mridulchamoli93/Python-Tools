# 📊 Sorting Visualization Tool (Python + Tkinter + Matplotlib)

A fully interactive **Sorting Algorithm Visualization Tool** designed to help students and developers understand how sorting algorithms work step-by-step.  
This project includes animated visual graphs, sorting speed comparison, and a user-friendly Tkinter interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎥 **Real-time sorting animations**
- 🔢 Visualizes comparison-based algorithms  
- 📈 Supports both **Bar Graph** & **Line Graph** views  
- 🧮 Adjustable data size & speed  
- 📝 Generate, edit & save custom number lists  
- 🖼 Clean UI with icons and images  
- 🔧 Organized code: modularized sorting methods & graph classes

## 📦 Requirements

Install these dependencies before running:

```

tkinter
matplotlib
os

````

Install matplotlib:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
````

Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python on most systems.

## 🔧 How It Works

### **1. User selects:**

* Sorting algorithm
* Data set size
* Visualization mode (Bar / Line)
* Sorting speed

### **2. The program:**

* Generates or loads a list
* Animates the sorting process
* Shows each step visually

### **3. Additional tools:**

* Custom list creation (via `ListMaker_Saver.py`)
* Saved list stored in `List_Number.txt`

---

## 📊 Supported Sorting Algorithms

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
  *(More can be added inside `Sorting_Methods.py`)*

---

## ▶️ How to Run

Simply run:

```bash
python Main.py
```

This starts the full visualization interface.
